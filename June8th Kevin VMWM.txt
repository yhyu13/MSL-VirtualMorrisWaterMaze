-switch from using a string to transfer commands from SocketListener to FPController (via ListenerHelper) to directly referencing FPController via SocketListener and adding Functions to FPController to do what we want
-Add a script to the Trigger object that implements OnCollisionEnter and OnCollisionExit, checking if the object which has collided with the trigger is the character - if true, save a boolean value which is Publicly accessible and allow AsyncSocketListener to view it for the GetRewardFeedback function
-for port switching: the server should have a list of usable ports. the client connects via 5005 (or default) and the listener sends back a port number and disconnects. the listener then begins listening on the new port number (the one it sent), and the c
lient, having received that number, attempts to connect on the new number. after that connection is established, communication continues as normal, allowing the next client to connect via that default port
